- What is the intended v1 distribution target (PyPI release, GitHub release assets, or repo-only)?
- Should v1 explicitly support Windows (sandbox execution is limited), or is macOS/Linux sufficient for now?
- Is a signed attestation required by default for v1, or is unsigned acceptable unless `attest` extras are installed?
- Are there specific CI providers or required status checks beyond GitHub Actions?
