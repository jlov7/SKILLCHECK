Use this page to disseminate SKILLCHECK consistently.

## Short pitch (1 sentence)

SKILLCHECK is a safety-first audit and governance layer for Agent Skills, combining lint, runtime probing, and provenance artifacts before enablement.

## Medium pitch (30 seconds)

SKILLCHECK gives teams a repeatable pre-enable workflow for Agent Skills. It statically lint-checks bundles against policy, probes for risky runtime behavior, emits attestation artifacts for auditability, and aggregates everything into a single report for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
